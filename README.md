# Poll Widget

This is a simple embed poll widget without using iframe. It allows displaying configurable questions with options and collects user votes.

### Usage
1. Include the `poll-widget.js` file in your HTML page.
2. Create an instance of `PollWidget` with the container selector and questions array.
3. Call the `render()` method to display the poll.

Example:
```html
<div id="poll-container"></div>
<script src="poll-widget.js"></script>
<script>
    const questions = [
        {
            question: "How you feel today:",
            options: ["Brilliant! I have so much energy", "Always can be worse.", "Please, end my misery."]
        }
    ];
    const pollWidget = new PollWidget("#poll-container", questions);
    pollWidget.render();
</script>



### Summary of Technical Choices:
- Used vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and reduced dependencies.
- Utilized local storage for storing user responses to avoid server-side setup.
- Separated concerns by creating a `PollWidget` class responsible for rendering polls and managing votes.
- Encapsulated widget initialization and rendering to ensure modularity and reusability.
- Provided documentation for usage and configuration in the README file.
- Ensured responsiveness and styling to improve user experience.

This implementation meets the requirements specified and provides a foundation for further enhancements and customizations.


###Improvements:
-  Persistence of votes across sessions: The current implementation uses localStorage to store the responses. This means that the votes are only saved locally on the userâ€™s machine. If the user clears their browser data or switches devices, the votes will be lost. A more robust solution would be to store the votes on a server.
- Internationalization of the text of the polls
